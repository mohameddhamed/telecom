Welcome! This repository contains a series of hands-on Python networking exercises designed to take you from basic sockets to building proxies and understanding data integrity.

## How to Use This Repository

The learning process is structured to help you learn effectively without accidentally spoiling the solutions.

**1. The `main` Branch (In Progress ðŸš§)**
This is the primary branch for working on the exercises. It contains:
- A folder for each practice session.
- `_todo.py` files with the exercise code you need to complete.
- A `README.md` in each folder explaining the objective and how to run the code.

**2. The `solutions` Branch (In Progress ðŸš§)**
This branch contains all the completed `_solution.py` files.
- **IMPORTANT:** Try your very best to solve the exercise yourself before looking at the solution!
- To view the solutions, switch to the `solutions` branch using the branch dropdown on GitHub or with the command:
  ```bash
  git checkout solutions


Of course! This is a fantastic idea. A well-structured GitHub repository is an invaluable tool for students. Here are my suggestions for a funny name, a good description, and a complete guide on how to structure the repo to maximize its educational value.

### **1. Name and Description**

A good name is memorable and sets a fun tone. A good description tells students exactly what they're getting into.

#### **Suggested Names (Pick your favorite):**

*   **Socket To 'Em:** A classic, punchy pun.
*   **PyNet Puzzles:** Emphasizes the problem-solving nature of the exercises.
*   **Unreliable Fun Datagrams:** A nerdy inside joke for those who understand UDP.
*   **The Packet Sniffer's Guide:** Sounds adventurous and hands-on.
*   **SYN-ACK-tical Solutions:** Another great networking pun.

#### **Repo Description:**

> A collection of hands-on Python networking exercises designed to take you from basic sockets to building proxies and understanding data integrity. Each exercise provides a `_todo.py` file to complete and a `_solution.py` to check your work. Let's get these packets moving!

### **2. How to Make the Repo Most Beneficial (The Complete Guide)**

This is the most important part. A great structure prevents confusion and guides learning.

#### **Step 1: Use a Two-Branch System (Crucial!)**

This is the best way to separate exercises from solutions and prevent students from accidentally seeing the answers.

*   **`main` Branch:** This is the default branch for students. It should contain **only the `_todo.py` files**, the READMEs, and any helper files (like `image_to_send.png`). **DO NOT** put solution files here.
*   **`solutions` Branch:** This branch contains everything from `main`, **plus** all the `_solution.py` files.

**How to set this up:**
1.  Create your repository and do all your initial work on the `main` branch.
2.  Once you have the `_todo` files and READMEs ready, create a new branch from `main` called `solutions`: `git branch solutions`.
3.  Switch to the new branch: `git checkout solutions`.
4.  Add all the `_solution.py` files, commit them, and push the branch: `git push -u origin solutions`.
5.  Switch back to `main` (`git checkout main`) for any future edits to the exercises.

#### **Step 2: Create a Clear Folder Structure**

Don't dump all the files in the root directory. Organize them by practice session or topic.

```

#### **Step 3: Write a High-Quality Main `README.md`**

This is the front door to your repository. It should be welcoming and informative.
